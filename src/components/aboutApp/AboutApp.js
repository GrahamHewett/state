        <p className='aboutAppParagraph'>“Connecting the world faster and easier than ever."</p>

        <h1>Vision</h1>

        <p className='aboutAppParagraph'>“To forever change the way we view networking.”</p>

                        <h1>The Why</h1>
        
                        <p className='aboutAppParagraph'>The whole premise around TAP is that it allows you to share information in an instant with the people around you through personalized/branded QR codes displayed on the wallpaper of your phone. It can be your contact details, the new app you just made, or your CV, and so forth, in fact you can have a code for every different occasion. TAP is about connecting people in all sorts of ways and it is in the control of the user of what they would like to share.</p>
        
                        <p className='aboutAppParagraph'>We can change the way people see networking through TAP but also simultaneously allowing users to promote their own brand or others via their phones’ displays. On average, people check their phones 60 times a day. Imagine, being exposed to a brand that many times in a day and that could be multiplied by days, months, or years dependent on the user.</p>
        
                        <p className='aboutAppParagraph'>QR Codes have been highly adopted in China due to its convenience and speed. WeChat, a multipurpose app, has made it incredibly easy for all different types of phones to scan QR codes. Majority of retailers in China use QR codes for mobile payments. That is not the case for Western Countries. We are slowly adopting it in social media apps with the likes of Snapchat and LinkedIn but we are still a long way from making it an efficiency in our everyday lives.</p>
        
                        <p className='finalParagraph'>TAP can change that.</p>
